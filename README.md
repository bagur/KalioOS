# KalioOS

A simple operating system written from scratch in C and assembly code. This is a personal learning project to understand more about the components/design decisions that go into an OS.

Inspired by http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf and http://www.jamesmolloy.co.uk/tutorial_html/. 

This is still a work in progress and I hope to add more features in the future. If you see any bugs, please feel free to point them out (I'm sure there are a few)
